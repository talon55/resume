As a mission-driven software engineer, I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer (Elixir) posisition at Vibrant Planet.
A role where I can work directly on the climate crisis is at the top of my list of interests,
so I was thrilled to connect with your colleague Heather Stone in a thread on
\href{https://heated.world/}{HEATED} and hear that you were hiring.
I have nearly 10 years of SaaS experience with a variety of companies and teams,
and I'd love the opportunity to leverage that to help California better adapt to modern wildfires.

In my last position at Spotify, I was the Tech Lead for a team of 22 people tasked with evaluating and implementing new ideas
and integrations in support of the Ads Business Development department. This was a team I helped build from the ground up after being
connected with someone on the business side to implement a proof-of-concept for a UX hypothesis.
Our work with that was successful enough that leadership provided us with resources to scale that product into a multi-service system,
and then to work on other high-value projects that the main Ads organization couldn't or wouldn't prioritize.
My team's work brought in more than \$70 million of added revenue in 2023.

Throughout my career, I've always valued the opportunity to learn new things when a project demands it.
I picked up mobile development to build the first version of The Stage (the result of that UX hypothesis),
distributed system design when we needed to scale it,
and mentorship, process design, and culture planning (all remotely) when we needed to build a team around it.
This was even working in a field (advertising) that I don't really care about,
so I'm confident that I'll be able to bring this flexibility to bear to solve whatever climate change-related problems
you need your team to tackle.

I look forward to meeting you and the team, and to learning how I might be able to support Vibrant Planet.
Thank you for your time and consideration. \newline
