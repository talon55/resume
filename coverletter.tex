As a mission-driven software engineer, I'm excited to apply for the Staff Software Engineer (Enterprise Events) position at Classy.
Classy's mission to enable better fundraising for non-profits has personal resonance for me, since I was briefly on the board of an
education non-profit, Black Oak Wilderness School (BOWS). BOWS failed in part because of financial difficulties,
and I think that might not have happened if we'd had access to a platform like Classy. I'd love to to spend my time
enabling non-profits to be more successful, so I was thrilled to see the posting for this position on your website.
I have nearly 10 years of SaaS experience with a variety of companies and teams,
and I'd love the opportunity to leverage that to support the non-profit space.

In my last position at Spotify, I was the Tech Lead for a large team tasked with evaluating and implementing new product ideas
and partner integrations in support of the Ads Business Development department.
I helped build that team from the ground up after being connected with someone on the business side to develop a proof-of-concept
for a UX hypothesis at the start of 2020. Our work with that was successful enough that leadership provided us with resources
to scale the product (now called The Stage) into a multi-service system, and we began hiring in 2021.
I played a major role in interviewing candidates and making hiring decisions,
and also led much of the work in planning and developing our team culture.
In 2022, our continued success in growing The Stage led us to be assigned even more resources,
as well as an expanded remit to work on on other high-value projects that the main Ads organization couldn't or wouldn't prioritize.
My team's work brought in more than \$70 million of added revenue in 2023, by which time we had grown to 22 people.

Throughout my career, I've always valued the opportunity to learn new things when a project demands it.
I picked up mobile development to build the first version of The Stage, system design when we needed to scale it,
and mentorship, process design, and culture planning (all remotely) when we needed to build a team around it.
This was all when working in a field (advertising) that wasn't my primary interest,
so I'm confident that I'll be able to bring this flexibility to bear to solve whatever problems
you need your team to tackle.

I look forward to meeting you and the team, and to learning how I might be able to support Classy.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
